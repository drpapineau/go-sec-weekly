# Go Security Projects – 2026

I am a cybersecurity engineer working in the financial sector.
In 2026, I committed to shipping **one Go project per week** focused on:

- Secure backend services
- DevSecOps tooling
- Realistic security PoCs
- Production-minded Go patterns

⚠️ All projects are educational and safe-by-design.

## Projects
| Week | Project | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 01 | Log Analyzer | Concurrency |
| 02 | Rate Limiter | DoS protection |
| 03 | Auth API | JWT |
...
| 52 | Secure Capstone | Defense-in-depth |

## Principles
- Small, auditable codebases
- Explicit threat models
- Tests over features
- Security-first defaults
