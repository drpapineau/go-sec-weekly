# Go Security Projects – 2026

I am a cybersecurity engineer working in the financial sector.
In 2026, I committed to shipping **one Go project per week** focused on:

- Secure backend services
- DevSecOps tooling
- Realistic security PoCs
- Production-minded Go patterns

⚠️ All projects are educational and safe-by-design.
